# Notes

## Systematic File Mapping:

- SSL files (Sound System and Script): Mapped to lessons in Parts 1 and 2
- Unit files: Mapped to chapters within their respective units
- Vocabulary files (V01, V02, etc.): Added as vocabulary arrays
- Exercise files (Ex01, Ex02, etc.): Added as exercise arrays
- Sub-exercises (Ex08_01, Ex08_02): Handled with subExercises structure

## File Naming Pattern Recognition:

- Pien7788_SSL11Ex02.mp3 → Sound System Lesson 11, Exercise 2
- Pien7788_U02Ch07V01.mp3 → Unit 2, Chapter 7, Vocabulary 1
- Pien7788_U03Ch13Ex08_01.mp3 → Unit 3, Chapter 13, Exercise 8, Sub-exercise 1

## Special Cases Handled:

- Sub-exercises with multiple parts
- Question files (like in Chapter 41)
- Missing chapters (Chapter 25 has no media files)

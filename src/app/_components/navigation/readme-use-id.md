# `useId` hook

The `useId` hook in React is primarily used to generate unique and stable IDs within your components. This is particularly useful for accessibility purposes and scenarios where you need to associate related elements in the DOM.

## Key uses of `useId`

- **Accessibility attributes:**

    It helps in linking form inputs with their corresponding labels, or associating other elements for improved accessibility. For example, you can use `useId` to generate an ID for an input field and then use that ID in the `htmlFor` attribute of its label.

- **Unique identification:**

    When you have multiple instances of the same component rendered on a page, `useId` ensures that each instance has unique IDs for its internal elements, preventing ID conflicts and ensuring correct behavior.

- **Server-side rendering (SSR) consistency:**

    `useId` generates IDs that are consistent between server-side and client-side renders, which is crucial for preventing hydration mismatches and ensuring smooth transitions in SSR applications.

- **Generating multiple related IDs:**

    You can use a single `useId` call and append suffixes to the generated ID to create unique IDs for multiple related elements within a component.

## When to use `useId`

- When you need to create unique IDs for accessibility attributes like `htmlFor`, `aria-labelledby`, or `aria-describedby`.
- When you are creating reusable components that might be rendered multiple times on a page and need unique IDs for their internal elements.
- When working with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and requiring consistent IDs between server and client.

## When not to use `useId`

- For CSS selectors, as the generated IDs contain colons, which can cause issues with some CSS selectors.
- For generating keys in a list; data-based keys are generally preferred for list rendering optimization.

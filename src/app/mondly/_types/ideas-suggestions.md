# Some suggestions and ideas for how you can upgrade the code further

## Using a Discriminated Union for Quiz Types

Since the `type` property in the `Quiz` object seems to be a key indicator for the structure of the quiz, you could use a TypeScript feature called a **discriminated union**. This would allow you to create a specific type for each of the 14 quiz shapes.

For example, a quiz of `type: "T1"` seems to have `tokens`, `tokensEqualSize`, and `ord` properties, while a different type might not. By defining a union, your code would be able to know exactly what properties are available for each quiz type, leading to more robust and type-safe code.

```ts
// Example of a discriminated union
export type T1Quiz = {
  type: "T1";
  // Add all T1 specific properties here
  tokens: QuizToken[];
  tokensEqualSize: boolean;
  ord: string[];
};

export type T2Quiz = {
  type: "T2";
  // Add all T2 specific properties here
  ...
};

export type Quiz = T1Quiz | T2Quiz | ... ; // Combine all quiz types into one union
```

This approach is a great way to handle the different shapes of your quizzes and can help prevent runtime errors when accessing properties that don't exist on a particular quiz type.

## Creating Enums for Quiz Types and Difficulty

To make your code more readable and maintainable, you could replace the string literals for `type` and `difficulty` with TypeScript `enums`. This would also prevent typos from causing bugs.

```ts
// Example of an Enum
export enum QuizType {
  T1 = "T1",
  T2 = "T2",
  // ... and so on for all 14 types
}

export enum Difficulty {
  BEGINNER = "beginner",
  INTERMEDIATE = "intermediate",
  ADVANCED = "advanced",
}

// Then you can use it in your types:
export type Quiz = {
  type: QuizType;
  // ...
};

export type LessonData = {
  lesson: {
    difficulty: Difficulty;
    // ...
  };
};
```

These suggestions will make your data definitions more specific and help you write more reliable and maintainable code in your application. Let me know if you would like me to implement these suggestions or if you want to explore any other code improvements!

## From "Karna" to "Kiye": A Modern Guide to Urdu Verbs (فعل)

In Urdu, if pronouns are the social compass of conversation, then verbs—the **"Fa'el" (فعل)**—are the engine that drives it. Verbs are the action words, the states of being, and the occurrences that bring a sentence to life.

But unlike English, where verbs often have a clear, consistent structure, Urdu verbs are a beautiful mosaic of gender, number, and tense. Mastering them is a key step to sounding natural and fluent. This article will demystify Urdu verbs in a modern, easy-to-understand way, using charts and practical examples to help you navigate their intricacies.

### The Foundation: The Infinitive Form

Every Urdu verb has a base form, called the infinitive, which is the equivalent of the English "to + verb" (e.g., "to eat," "to go"). This form is easily recognizable because it always ends in the syllable **"na" (نا)**.

**Examples of Infinitive Verbs:**

| Urdu | Roman | English |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **کرنا** | Karna | To do |
| **جانا** | Jana | To go |
| **لکھنا** | Likhna | To write |
| **کھانا** | Khana | To eat |
| **پڑھنا** | Parhna | To read |

To conjugate a verb, you simply drop the final "na" (نا) to get the root. This root is the building block for all tenses and forms.

### The Dynamic Duo: Tense and Agreement

The most important thing to remember about Urdu verbs is that they must agree with the subject in **gender** (masculine or feminine) and **number** (singular or plural). This is a concept that is less prominent in English, but it's central to Urdu grammar.

#### A Quick Guide to Verb Endings

Here's a simplified look at how verb endings change based on gender and number in a simple present tense:

| Subject | Masculine Ending | Feminine Ending | Plural Ending (Masculine/Feminine) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I (میں)** | **تا ہوں** (ta hoon) | **تی ہوں** (ti hoon) |
| **You (تم)** | **تے ہو** (te ho) | **تی ہو** (ti ho) |
| **He/She/It (وہ)** | **تا ہے** (ta hai) | **تی ہے** (ti hai) |
| **We (ہم)** | **تے ہیں** (te hain) | **تی ہیں** (ti hain) |
| **You (آپ)** | **تے ہیں** (te hain) | **تی ہیں** (ti hain) |
| **They (وہ)** | **تے ہیں** (te hain) | **تی ہیں** (ti hain) |

*Note: The plural endings for "we," "you" (formal), and "they" are the same for both genders in the simple present tense.*

### Conjugation in the Modern World: Tense by Tense

Let's use the verb **"Karna" (کرنا)**, meaning "to do," as our example to explore the most common tenses.

#### 1. The Present Tense (زمانۂ حال - Zamana-e-Haal)

This tense is used for actions happening now or for habitual actions. It's the most common tense in everyday conversation.

| Subject | Conjugation (Urdu) | Roman | English |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **میں** (M) | میں کام **کرتا ہوں** | Main kaam **karta hoon** | I do work. |
| **میں** (F) | میں کام **کرتی ہوں** | Main kaam **karti hoon** | I do work. |
| **وہ** (M) | وہ کام **کر رہا ہے** | Woh kaam **kar raha hai** | He is doing work. |
| **وہ** (F) | وہ کام **کر رہی ہے** | Woh kaam **kar rahi hai** | She is doing work. |

#### 2. The Past Tense (زمانۂ ماضی - Zamana-e-Maazi)

This tense is used for actions that have already been completed. This is where the agreement with gender and number becomes particularly important. The past tense of many verbs can be formed by adding a suffix to the verb stem, but there are some common irregularities, especially with verbs like "Karna."

| Subject | Conjugation (Urdu) | Roman | English |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **میں** | میں نے کام **کیا** | Main ne kaam **kiya** | I did the work. |
| **ہم** | ہم نے کام **کیا** | Hum ne kaam **kiya** | We did the work. |
| **وہ** (M) | اس نے کام **کیا** | Us ne kaam **kiya** | He did the work. |
| **وہ** (F) | اس نے کام **کیا** | Us ne kaam **kiya** | She did the work. |
| **وہ** (Plural) | انہوں نے کام **کیا** | Unhon ne kaam **kiya** | They did the work. |

**Modern Tip:** In the past tense, the pronoun "ne" (نے) is often used to mark the subject of a transitive verb (a verb that takes an object). This can be a tricky rule, but you'll get the hang of it with practice.

#### 3. The Future Tense (زمانۂ مستقبل - Zamana-e-Mustaqbil)

The future tense in Urdu is relatively simple and follows a predictable pattern, primarily using the ending **"ga" (گا)** for masculine and **"gi" (گی)** for feminine.

| Subject | Conjugation (Urdu) | Roman | English |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **میں** | میں کام **کروں گا** (M) | Main kaam **karoon ga** | I will do work. |
| **میں** | میں کام **کروں گی** (F) | Main kaam **karoon gi** | I will do work. |
| **ہم** | ہم کام **کریں گے** | Hum kaam **karen ge** | We will do work. |
| **وہ** (M) | وہ کام **کرے گا** | Woh kaam **kare ga** | He will do work. |
| **وہ** (F) | وہ کام **کرے گی** | Woh kaam **kare gi** | She will do work. |

### The Irregulars: Verbs with a Twist

Like any language, Urdu has a few irregular verbs that don't follow the standard conjugation rules. The most famous of these is the verb **"Hona" (ہونا)**, which means "to be." It's essential for forming many tenses and phrases.

**The Forms of "Hona" (to be):**

| Urdu | Roman | English |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ہوں** | Hoon | am |
| **ہے** | Hai | is |
| **ہیں** | Hain | are |
| **تھا** | Tha | was (M) |
| **تھی** | Thi | was (F) |
| **تھے** | Thay | were (M/F Plural) |

### Putting It All Together: A Digital Conversation

Imagine you're chatting with a friend on a messaging app. The way you use verbs is what makes the conversation feel real.

**Friend 1:** "Kya **kar rahe ho**?" (What are you **doing**? - M)
**Friend 2:** "Main office mein kaam **kar raha hoon**." (I **am doing** work in the office. - M)
**Friend 1:** "Aaj ka project **ho gaya**?" (Has today's project **been done**?)
**Friend 2:** "Nahin, abhi nahin. Kal **karein ge**." (No, not yet. We **will do** it tomorrow.)

In this simple exchange, you can see the fluidity of the verbs, adapting to person, gender, and tense without a second thought. That's the goal. Don't be intimidated by the charts; they're just a blueprint. The real mastery comes from practice and immersion. So start small, learn a few key verbs, and watch your Urdu communication skills flourish.
